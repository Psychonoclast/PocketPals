# PocketPals
A mod for Caves of Qud adding various creatures and features from the hit franchise Pokémon.

PocketPals Version 0.11


### intro ###

Hello dear friend!

Here is my first released mod. For anything! Ever!
It all began with a couple of screenshots I posted for funsies. Due to the warm reception I have decided to continue and see how far I can get.
So far implementation is simple, there is some evolution, a few moves implemented, a couple abilities, no wild encounters, and no capturing.
That said, I hope you enjoy my work and find a valuable companion for your journeys.

Live and drink
